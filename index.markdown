# Introduction

---

# Guide Tags

---

![Core]

These mods are key elements of the modlist and should not be excluded without the ability to remove them from official patches and make your own patches.

---

![OptionalLg]

These mods can be excluded from the modlist without impacting conflict resolution or having other effects on the core gameplay beyond what is expected from that specific mod.

---

![VisualsLg]

These mods contain textures or meshes; the guide recommends 4K for architecture and bigger objects and creatures, and 2K for smaller things such as clutter or armor.  A higher or lower resolution can be used for any given texture based on your own system.  If a mod only has the Visuals tag, then it is implied to be Optional but is still recommended.

---

![BSA]

These mods should have their BSAs extracted when installing in MO2.  Mods that do not have this tag should not be extracted unless you know what you're doing with texture, mesh, and script overrides.

---

![CK]

These mods will need to be resaved in the Creation Kit to fix a variety of issues.

---

![CAO]

These mods will be packed or repacked with Cathedral Assets Optimizer to create a new BSA.

---

![FOMOD]

Instructions about what options to pick in a FOMOD when installing.  As a general rule, if an option is not specifically mentioned then it should be "None" or *unchecked*.

---

![PostInstall]

Instructions on files to move or delete *within the mod* after installing into MO2.

---

![Adventures]

The Adventures module is an optional add-on to Core.  It contains Legacy of the Dragonborn, supporting quest and world content for it, the ability to alter the state of locations via Skyrim Realistic Conquering and Lawbringer, and some other curated mods.  All of the mods in Adventures that are not purely Visual must be installed, as there is a single set of conflict resolution patches covering all of them and their interaction with Core mods.

---

![Arch]

Project Arch is an optional add-on to Core and Adventures (both required).  It combines several popular city and town overhauls, notably but not limited to: JK's Skyrim, Expanded Towns and Cities, Blue Palace Terrace, Cities of the North Dawnstar, Cities of the North Falkreath, Rodryk's Dragon Bridge, Capital Windhelm Expansion, and Quaint Raven Rock.  All conflicts between these mods and the ones in Core and Adventures are resolved in a single set of conflict resolution patches, so all mods within this category are required.

---

![Addon]

Several addons are available in this section, with varying requirements on the other modules that will be stated in the description of each.  Several followers who are not included in Core can be found here, as well as enhancements to follower and trader npcs, and several optional additions to Arch including JK's interior mods.
